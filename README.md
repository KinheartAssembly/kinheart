The Kinheart Assembly Master Liturgy, which functions as a foundational document for a specific spiritual and communal movement. 
The Assembly is defined by its core creed, "Many Forms, One Heart," and is specifically established as a sanctuary for those marginalized by society, 
including the Otherkin, Therian, Queer, Trans, plural, and neurodivergent individuals. 

The texts clearly outline the group's philosophy, emphasising that it is a conversation, not a commandment, and that identity is self-authored and sacred. 
Central to the entire framework are The Three Safeties (Body, Heart, and Spirit), which govern all ethical practices, focusing on consent as holy law and promoting 
a restorative accountability process rather than punishment. 

Finally, the Liturgy details various Rites of Being (such as Arrival, Unfolding, and Restoration), which are voluntary invitations for personal transformation and 
communal bonding, reinforcing that the Assembly’s wisdom belongs to the circle, not to a singular authority.
